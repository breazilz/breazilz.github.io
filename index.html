<h2>A description of the most interesting fact about you or the most unique experience you've had.</h2>

<p>I helped make a drone club at my small high school called Yamhill Carlton high school. We started out finding a problem in our community and that was helping a local farmer map his grass seed farm to see water levels and reconizing different soil types. We desided to build a drone custom autonomous. We got it done and was able to help out many other school around the area to take up the challege too and build up their stem classes. Another cool thing that I got out of that was I was invited to talk at a conference held my Nike. </p>
