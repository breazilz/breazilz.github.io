<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>

<p>The thing that I had challenge with is making sure my webpage looked good with the limited commands that we know. 
    I mainly looked at class resources like the example code that we got from that week in leacture.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<p>I learn the basics of making a HTML page without the need of CSS or java. Also how simple it is to make a HTML page and how to formate a page with h1,h2,h3,p and
    the image command. From the start of the class I had no idea how to even make or run an HTML file but with the lectures and the example code I was able to over
    come that and make my first file.</p>

<h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

<p>I mainly reviewed the lecture videos on canvas to check commands that I had no idea about like linking files together. For more simple commands I used a website called w3schools
    to really help me out remembering the image command and what head and body does to an HTML page.
