<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>

<p>The thing that I had challenge with is making sure my webpage looked good with the limited commands that we know. 
    I mainly looked at class resources like the example code that we got from that week in leacture.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<p>I learn the basics of making a HTML page without the need of CSS or java. Also how simple it is to make a HTML page and how to formate a page with h1,h2,h3,p and
    the image command. From the start of the class I had no idea how to even make or run an HTML file but with the lectures and the example code I was able to over
    come that and make my first file.</p>

<h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

<p>I mainly reviewed the lecture videos on canvas to check commands that I had no idea about like linking files together. For more simple commands I used a website called w3schools
    to really help me out remembering the image command and what head and body does to an HTML page.

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p>The most challenging thing about this project was getting everything in place like the post being on the right of the page and the filters tab. I think that was the hardest
    because I didn't know much about placement until that class that we talked about it. I remeber watching that video 5 times to make sure I knew the commands and after watching
    it made it so much better in solving this issue. Also something strange was happening with colors from the project not displaying in my mock photos and changing over to my
    laptop solved that issue but it was still strange.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p> OMG, I learned a lot, I learned how to move things into place, make reactibale buttons, how to import fonts, and making everything look nice. There was no special insights,
    and I didn't know anything when I first started this assignment.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p>The biggest one that helped out in completing this aassignment was w3school it shows really good examples to help you improve your code. Also another big one was going to TA's 
    office hours too because I was able to get some constuctive criticism to help me finish this awesome project.</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p>The one thing that I had to google to complete this assignment was looking up a command for CSS called transform. It allowed me to change the size of the sell button super easily.
    Because at the start I had no idea how to change the size and I just thought of something janky that didn't work but after finding that it helped so much.</p>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
    
<p>The biggest challege that I had with the project was making the new posts on the page and assinging the correct values to make sure that it formated fine.
    I got some help from TA's to help break it down and understand it.
</p>
    
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
    
<p> I leanred how to add new posts by the existing resources in the HTML and how to filter the existing resources using javascript. I knew nothing on how to do anything with.</p>
    
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
    
<p>I used w2school to help make again and I think I'll use it more with future projects XD. Also the lectures where a big part too mainly with assigning elemetns the user input
    and how to assign them values based the HTML couterpart.
</p>
    
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
    
<p>The one thing that I needed help on was how to assign button functionality in javascript I had a hard time and got so many errors but was able to figure it out after.</p>

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>
    
<p> I had an issue when I needed to name the content-type for for the style.css because it would just not accept the content type of text/css.
But after finding the issue I typed it in incorectly.
</p>
    
<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>
    
<p> I knew nothing going into this project besides going to leacture the issue. I learned how to get a local server up and how to access it via my machine.</p>
    
<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>
    
<p>The leactures were a huge part in helping me get this project done. Without those videos I would have no way in doing this project.
</p>
    
<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>
    
<p> I had to look up the content-types to make sure that all the types were correct.</p>
