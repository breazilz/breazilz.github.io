<h2>What challenges or troubles did you have completing this assignment. How did you work through them?</h2>

<p>The thing that I had challenge with is making sure my webpage looked good with the limited commands that we know. 
    I mainly looked at class resources like the example code that we got from that week in leacture.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from this assignment? What did you already know?</h2>

<p>I learn the basics of making a HTML page without the need of CSS or java. Also how simple it is to make a HTML page and how to formate a page with h1,h2,h3,p and
    the image command. From the start of the class I had no idea how to even make or run an HTML file but with the lectures and the example code I was able to over
    come that and make my first file.</p>

<h2>What resources were most helpful in completing this assignment? How did you use these resources?</h2>

<p>I mainly reviewed the lecture videos on canvas to check commands that I had no idea about like linking files together. For more simple commands I used a website called w3schools
    to really help me out remembering the image command and what head and body does to an HTML page.

<h2>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did you have. How did you solve those problems?</h2>

<p>The most challenging thing about this project was getting everything in place like the post being on the right of the page and the filters tab. I think that was the hardest
    because I didn't know much about placement until that class that we talked about it. I remeber watching that video 5 times to make sure I knew the commands and after watching
    it made it so much better in solving this issue. Also something strange was happening with colors from the project not displaying in my mock photos and changing over to my
    laptop solved that issue but it was still strange.</p>

<h2>What did you learn from the assignment? Were there any special insights you had? What did you find that you already knew?</h2>

<p> OMG, I learned a lot, I learned how to move things into place, make reactibale buttons, how to import fonts, and making everything look nice. There was no special insights,
    and I didn't know anything when I first started this assignment.</p>

<h2>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did you use each of these resources?</h2>

<p>The biggest one that helped out in completing this aassignment was w3school it shows really good examples to help you improve your code. Also another big one was going to TA's 
    office hours too because I was able to get some constuctive criticism to help me finish this awesome project.</p>

<h2>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h2>

<p>The one thing that I had to google to complete this assignment was looking up a command for CSS called transform. It allowed me to change the size of the sell button super easily.
    Because at the start I had no idea how to change the size and I just thought of something janky that didn't work but after finding that it helped so much.</p>
